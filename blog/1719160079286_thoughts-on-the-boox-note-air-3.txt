2:T413,To be frank, the pen did not excite me at first. It is a simple EMR pen with no button. The fact that it does not come with a built-in eraser like the Samsung S Pen or the pen for Boox Nova 2 that I used to have is a bit disappointing. Upon using it for some time though, I found it to be really comfortable to hold and write with. The default nib that comes with the device is neither too soft nor hard, and the writing experience feels similar to writing on paper. I don't think it is exactly like writing on a piece of paper, but the experience is certainly way better than writing on a glass surface like an iPad or Samsung tablet. What's more, I have not experienced any noticeable lag or delay when writing the pen. However, the nib does wear off quickly for me, so I changed to a metal nib which I bought from an unofficial store. The metal nib feels a bit slippery but still provides a paper-like feel for writing. Having used the metal nib for a few months, I have yet to see any scratches on the screen, so I think it is safe to use.0:["xVf4pkAUKKgFjdZe4myT8",[[["",{"children":["blog",{"children":["1719160079286_thoughts-on-the-boox-note-air-3",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["blog",{"children":["1719160079286_thoughts-on-the-boox-note-air-3",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",["$","main",null,{"id":"__main-content","children":[["$","aside",null,{"className":"text-center","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm","children":["Published: ","2024-06-26"]}],"$undefined",["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center text-sm gap-2","children":[["$","span",null,{"children":"Tags: "}],["$","ul",null,{"className":"__unwrap-content flex flex-wrap items-baseline gap-2","children":[["$","li","review",{"className":"text-xs uppercase p-1 border border-teal-50","children":"review"}],["$","li","boox",{"className":"text-xs uppercase p-1 border border-teal-50","children":"boox"}],["$","li","e-reader",{"className":"text-xs uppercase p-1 border border-teal-50","children":"e-reader"}]]}]]}],["$","h1",null,{"children":"Thoughts on the Boox Note Air 3"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm text-slate-300","children":"My review on the Boox Note Air 3 e-reader from a student's and programmer's perspective."}]]}],["$","hr",null,{}],[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-stone-400 bg-slate-800 py-2 px-8 mt-2 mb-8","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-stone-300","children":"Summary"}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"I have been using the Boox Note Air 3 (monochrome) for half a year now, and I think it adds a lot of value to my daily work and studies.

I was never a big fan of paper note-taking, but those devices were either too heavy, too slow, too small, or too slippery to write on to sway me into ditching my paper notebooks. The cloest I got to a decent note-taking experience was with the Boox Nova 2, but it was sluggish and the screen was rather small to be an effective note-taking device.

The official case is a nice accessory of which the quality matches the device very well.

While I find the list mode to be more useful as it shows more notes at once, it can only show upto 15 items (vertical) or 11 items (horizontal) on a page. As I create more new notes in the same folder, I can foresee the need to scroll a lot to find the note I want to open. To mitigate this issue, the system allows you to search for notes by their titles and tags. However, I find the search function to be a little lacking.
