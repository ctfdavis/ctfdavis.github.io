<Summary>
I have been using the Boox Note Air 3 (monochrome) for half a year now, and I think it adds a lot of value to my daily work and studies. To me, it is a great e-ink tablet for writing and note-taking.

It is not perfect, but the pros easily outweigh the cons for me. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a digital note-taking device.

## Where It Started

Last December, I decided to reward myself with something to boost my productivity going into the new year. I was eager to give digital note-taking on a tablet another try, but could not shake off the negative experiences I had got. I had already owned a Boox Nova 2, an iPad Pro, and a Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Despite numerous attempts, none of them managed to replace my need for paper notebooks. I was not a big fan of paper note-taking, but those devices were either too heavy, too slow, too small, or too slippery to write on to sway me into ditching my paper notebooks. The cloest I got to a decent note-taking experience was with the Boox Nova 2, but it was sluggish and the screen was rather small to be an effective note-taking device. In particular, the small screen made it difficult to write comfortably, especially when I was brainstorming or sketching diagrams.

So I was eyeing the Remarkable 2 or the SuperNote A5X as I had heard good things about them. While the former has a bigger screen and looks aesthetic, many have mentioned its lacking in functionality and software. The latter is speedier and has superior features according to [a number of users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/16zk1ve/remarkable_2_vs_supernote/). What's more, it has an appealing [website](https://supernote.com/), but alas, I did not want another small size tablet yet.

While I was sturggling to find the right e-ink tablet, the Boox Note Air 3 was [announced](https://shop.boox.com/blogs/news/meet-the-boox-note-air3). It was the perfect timing. I was already familiar with the Boox brand, and the Note Air 3 seemed to have addressed the gripes I had with the Nova 2. I decided to give it a try.

## The Good: Case, Pen, Screen, Speed, Fingerprint Scanner & Battery Life

When I received my Boox Note Air 3 in early January, the first thing that struck me was how lightweight and premium the device and leather case felt. The device looks stylish with the 'BOOX' brand in contrasting orange, located on the slate-gray portion that covers the left side of the front panel. The official case is a nice accessory of which the quality matches the device very well. Not only does it offer sleekness, protection, and auto-sleep/wake functionality, it has a tri-fold design and provides a "slot" to hold the pen securely. While I have never wanted fold the case to stand the device up since I would only place it flat on a desk for writing, I could imagine how it could be useful for people who prefer to read or annotate with the device standing. Overall, I am satified with the case. However, it is worth-noting there are other third-party cases that offer more functionality, such as an actual slot for storing the pen like [the one by FinTie](https://www.amazon.com/Fintie-Case-Tablet-ePaper-Built/dp/B0CRH87VZJ?th=1&language=en_US) which I am considering to get.

Speaking of the pen, the device shipped with the [Pen Plus](https://shop.boox.com/products/pen-plus?variant=43201860927718), which magnetically attaches to the side of the device. Though the magnet is strong, the pen could fall off when the device is being moved around or jostled. With the official case, you can be highly confident that the pen won't fall off when you carry the device around as its strap secures the pen in place, as long as you are not too rough with it.

To be frank, the pen did not excite me at first. It is a simple EMR pen with no button. The fact that it does not come with a built-in eraser like the Samsung S Pen or the pen for Boox Nova 2 that I used to have is a bit disappointing. However, upon using it for some time, I think it is really comfortable to hold and write with. The default nib that comes with the device is neither too soft nor hard, and the writing experience feels similar to writing on paper. I don't think it is exactly like writing on a piece of paper, but the experience is certainly way better than writing on a glass surface like an iPad or Samsung tablet. What's more, I have not experienced any noticeable lag or delay when writing the pen. However, the nib does wear off quickly for me, so I changed to a metal nib which I bought from an unofficial store. The metal nib feels a bit slippery but still provides a paper-like feel when used to write. Having used the metal nib for a few months, I have yet to see any scratches on the screen, so I think it is safe to use.

When it comes to the screen, the 10.3-inch E Ink Carta display is big enough for me to write comfortably (a big contrast to the 7.8-inch Boox Nova 2), and the resolution is high enough for me to see the content clearly. To be fair, the screen is technically not as sharp as the Boox Nova 2 due to a lower PPI (227PPI vs 300PPI), but in practice, I did not notice much of a difference. The screen is naturally bright and remains very readable under both direct sunlight and indoor light conditions. It is also very power-efficient, and I can use the device for days without needing to charge it.

Finally, I must priase the fingerprint scanner that is located on the top of the device. It is reasonably responsive and accurate. It may look like a small feature, but it is actually significant because it makes unlocking the device a breeze. On other e-ink devices, you would have to enter a password or a pin to unlock the device, which can be a hassle.
