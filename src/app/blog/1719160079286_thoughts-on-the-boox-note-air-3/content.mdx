<Summary>
I have been using the Boox Note Air 3 (monochrome) for half a year now, and I think it adds a lot of value to my daily work and studies. To me, it is a great e-ink tablet for writing and note-taking.

It is not perfect, but the pros easily outweigh the cons for me. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a digital note-taking device.

## Where It Started

Last December, I decided to reward myself with something to boost my productivity going into the new year. I was eager to give digital note-taking on a tablet another try, but could not shake off the negative experiences I had got. I had already owned an Boox Nova 2, an iPad Pro, and a Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Despite my best efforts, none of them managed to replace my paper notebooks. These devices were either too heavy, too slow, too small, or too slippery to write on. The cloest I got to a decent note-taking experience was from the Boox Nova 2, but it was a bit sluggish and the screen was quite small for my liking. In particular, the small screen size made it difficult to write comfortably, especially when I was brainstorming or sketching diagrams.

At first, I was eyeing the Remarkable 2 or the SuperNote A5X. While the former has a bigger screen, many have mentioned its lacking in functionality and software. The latter seems to be speedy and have superior software. What's more, it has a really appealing [website](https://supernote.com/), but alas, the small size is a huge concern. While I was doing more research, the Boox Note Air 3 was [announced](https://shop.boox.com/blogs/news/meet-the-boox-note-air3). It was the perfect timing. I was already familiar with the Boox brand, and the Note Air 3 seemed to have addressed all the gripes I had with the Nova 2. I decided to give it a try.

## The Good: Case, Pen, Screen, Note-taking, Fingerprint Scanner & Battery Life

When I received my Boox Note Air 3 in early January, the first thing that struck me was how lightweight and premium the device body and leather case felt. The device looks stylish with the 'BOOX' brand in contrasting orange, located on the slate-gray portion that covers the left side of the front panel. On the other hand, the official case is a must-have accessory for the Note Air 3. Not only does it offer sleekness, protection, and auto-sleep/wake functionality, it also has a tri-fold design and provides a slot to hold the pen securely. I don't fold the case to stand the device up often since I mostly place it flat on a desk for writing, but I think it would work well for those who prefer to read or annotate with the device standing. The pen magnetically attaches to the side of the device. While the magnet is quite strong, the pen can still fall off when the device is being moved around or jostled. With the case,
